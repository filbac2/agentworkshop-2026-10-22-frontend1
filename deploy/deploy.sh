#
# The server is taken from, in this order:  HOST=root@<ip>  ->  the file .deploy-host (gitignored)  ->  abort.
# The domain is read from .board-url. Port, service name and directories were stamped in when this repo was
# built from the workshop template, and can be overridden with an environment variable for a single run.
# No address and no key is stored in the repo: this script is a template, not a configuration.
#
# Secrets (LEAD_TOKEN) are NOT handled here. They live in /etc/torget/<service>.env on the server, written by
# the organiser's tooling, and the systemd unit reads them with EnvironmentFile=. This repo is public.
#
# Requires: ssh to the server works, node and Caddy are installed there.
# DNS (the domain -> the server's IP) must exist before Caddy can fetch a certificate.

If you run release rounds during the day, .deploy-host must exist in the repo root you run them from.
